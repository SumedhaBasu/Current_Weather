# Current_Weather
The current weather Python script provides the user the current weather conditions of any location of the world. It returns:
- Current Date 
- Current Time
- Current Temperature
- Temperature it feels like
- Maximum Temperature
- Minimum Temperature
- Current Weather Description
- Current Humidity
- Current Wind Speed

## How we built it:
The whole script is written in **Python 3.10.1**. 
The "Current Weather Data" from **OpenWeatherMap API** is used to collect all the weather condition data in the form of .json file.
Code Editor used is **Visual Studio Code**.
The API key has been stored in **Windows Environment Variables** to secure the information.

## What we learned
1. Using an API to collect information.
2. Storing sensitive information like API key and passwords in Windows Environment Variables, thus increasing security.
3. Extracting data in form of .json file

## What's next for Current Weather
The script will be further developed into an **Weather App**. It will also be used in other projects to bring extra functionality to the project. Overall it is very useful since weather data is an essential information used in various fields.
